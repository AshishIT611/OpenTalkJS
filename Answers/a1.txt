### Steps

#### Preparing the Blueberry Cheese Cake batter

1. **Mix Flour and Baking Powder**: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and baking powder.
2. **Subdivide**: Divide the mixture into separate bowls for each ingredient: butter, sugar, blueberries (optional), vanilla extract.

#### Making the Blueberry Cream Cheese frosting

1. **Whisk Butter**: Pour in butter with whisking speed at about 60 seconds on medium speed.
2. **Mix Brown Sugar**: Add sugar one tablespoon at a time until combined. Don't overmix as this can cause the frosting to be too sticky.
