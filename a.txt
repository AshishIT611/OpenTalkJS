In the green of spring's first light,
Where leaves turn to gold and dew falls,
The air is fresh, oh so rich.
And there's beauty to see in this place,
A world of wonder, far beyond our sight.

The sun sets on its golden hour,
As stars twinkle above, a sight unseen,
And nature sings a harmonious song,
Of colors, sounds, and life's sound.

With bees buzzing with energy to make,
Their work so sweet, as they gather,
On the river's gentle flow,
A world of beauty and grace.

In this vastness of nature's sight,
We're boundless, without bounds.
For we are part of its magic,
And for that reason, we must protect.
