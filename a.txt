Here is a poem about nature:

Oh, how I love the beauty of the natural world,
A grand display, a spectacle so sublime.
From mountains and sea to forests and skies,
Where birds sing their sweet songs and weep.

The sun rises high on the horizon,
And shines with pure gold and hues bright.
The air is alive with sound and color's delight,
A symphony of nature's breath.

From tree to tree, from mountain to meadow,
Each one holds its place with love and care.
In this world of beauty, we find peace too,
A sanctuary for the weary soul.

Nature, your beauty in every single line,
Is a reminder that life is worth savoring.
Let us cherish our earth's gift, now and always,
For it is our home, we will leave to know.
