Here's a poem about nature:

Spring is here,  
A sight to behold,
The buds are soft and pale,
Nature awakens.
Birds are singing,
The air feels fresh,
The leaves are falling,
Nature is now in charge.

Water flows freely,
Drops of dew sparkle like stars,
Eco-friendly plants grow,
Nature has a way of stirring.

Autumn's beauty is a sight to behold too,
The trees are changing,
Colors shift from gold to red and pink,
Nature at its very best.

The leaves fall to the ground,
The trees take their places, 
The soil becomes rich with nutrients,
Nature's final gift.

A season of growth,
A time for us all to breathe,
Nature is a treasure trove,
In this moment we see.
So let's cherish this moment and remember,
That the earth deserves our love.
